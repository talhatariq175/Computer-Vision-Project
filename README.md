# 🎓 Computer Vision Project – MSc Coursework

This repository contains practical exercises from my Master's degree coursework in Computer Vision at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg.  
Each exercise explores key concepts like 3D data processing, image segmentation, and geometric analysis using Python.

## 📘 Contents

| Exercise | Topic                     | Description |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| [Exercise 01](./exercise-01-box-detection) | Box Detection with Using RANSAC and Image Processing | Estimate a box’s dimensions using RANSAC, 3D point clouds, and image processing |
| [Exercise 02](./exercise-02-writer-retrieval) | Writer Retreival using SIFT features | Built an image retrieval system to identify document authors based on handwriting. Implemented the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) model using VLAD encoding, k-means clustering, and Exemplar-SVMs. |

> More exercises will be added as the course progresses.
